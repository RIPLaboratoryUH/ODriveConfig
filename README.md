To config the ODrive, first install ODriveTool by following the instructions here: https://docs.odriverobotics.com/v/latest/interfaces/odrivetool.html

Note that it is easiest to install teh tool globally, even though Linux will warn you against it.

Once that is installed, launch odrivetool from your command prompt, connect your ODrive, and run the commands in the config block by block

Don't forget to change the CAN ID as required! That is the only variable that changes between ODrives
